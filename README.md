DSA project - R tree

How to use the code:

1. Simply compile the code, and execute.
2. You will be asked to enter name of ile containing data.
3. Enter name only, for example: data.txt
4. Do not add any whitespaces or quotes, before or after file name.
5. Ensure file is in the same folder as code.

Code will automatically read the data, create R-tree, and display the R-tree, while traversing in preorder.
