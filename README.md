DSA project - R tree

How to use the code:

Simply compile the code, and execute.
You will be asked to enter name of ile containing data.
Enter name only, for example: data.txt
Do not add any whitespaces or quotes, before or after file name.
Ensure file is in the same folder as code.
Code will automatically read the data, create R-tree, and display the R-tree, while traversing in preorder.
